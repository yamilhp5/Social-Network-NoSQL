# Social-Network-NoSQL

## Description 
Our challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages.

No seed data is provided, so you’ll need to create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.

## User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia

## Installation 
To be able to use this repo, make sure you have installed all the necessary npm packages installed including MongoDB. 
    npm i pg
    npm i express
    npm i mongoose

## Usage

  1. Ensure dependencies are installed on your device.
  2. Right click on "Server.js" and run in Terminal.
  3. In order to connect to server, type in "node server.js"
  4. You will want to check on insomnia each route; There is no seeds in this assignment so we can see the route is     
     functional due to the 200 code that pops up and thats it!
